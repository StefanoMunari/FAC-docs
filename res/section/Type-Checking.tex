\section{Type-Checking}
\label{sec:type-checking}
In our implementation we distinguish two types:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|BOOL_T| -- on this type only the following
operations can be performed:

\begin{itemize}
\item logical negation \verb|(NOT a)|
\item logical and \verb|(a AND b)|
\item logical or  \verb|(a OR b)|
\item logical implication \verb|(a IMPLY b)| --
desugared as \verb|((NOT a) OR b)|
\item logical biconditional \verb|(a IFF b)| -- when it is time
to print it into an output file it is desugared as an equality 
between variables.
\item logical exclusive or \verb|(a XOR b)| -- when it is time to print
it into a c output file it is desugared as a disequality.
\end{itemize}

\item \verb|FRACT_T| -- the numerical type, on which the following 
operations can be performed:
\begin{itemize}
\item sum (\verb|SUM|)
\item difference (\verb|DIFF|)
\item multiplication (\verb|MULT|)
\item division (\verb|DIV|)
\item less than (\verb|LT|)
\item less than or equal (\verb|LTE|)
\item greater than or equal (\verb|GEQ|)
\item greater than (\verb|GT|)
\item equals (\verb|EQ|)
\item not equals(\verb|NEQ|)
\item sign plus (\verb|Plus|)
\item sign minus (\verb|Minus|)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
