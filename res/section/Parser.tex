\section{Parser}
\label{sec:parser}
The main goal of the parser written in bison is to check the
syntax correctness and to produce the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). 

\subsection{F -- Syntax choice}
We think that a language targeted to girls and boys of the middle-school,
that are neophyte programmers should be strongly typed (in order to 
learn how a high-level language works), but at the same
time easy to use. Thus we introduce some syntactic sugar, e.g. we 
provide directly the implication operator between boolean expression.
