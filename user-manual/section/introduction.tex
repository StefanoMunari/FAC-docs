\section*{Introduction}

FAC has the following \textbf{mandatory} dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Python - to assemble the lexer components;
	\item Flex - to generate the lexer;
	\item Bison - to generate the parser;
	\item GCC - to compile and run FAC;
	\item GNU Make - to automate and manage the project steps
	(build, run, etc.).
\end{itemize}

The following dependencies are optional but suggested for dev usage:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Doxygen - to generate the documentation of the FAC source code;
	\item Valgrind - to perform memory profiling and debugging.
\end{itemize}

The usage of the make utility is described in the following sections.
\\
Please make sure that you have the make utility installed (e.g. in Linux and
Debian based distros it is part of the build-essential package\footnote{
\url{https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/build-essential}}).
