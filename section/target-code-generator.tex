\section{Target Code Generator}

In FAC, the target code generator (aka printer) takes the
three address code (3AC) of an F program given as input and generates a version
of this code translated into a targeted representation.
\\
We have implemented the printer by constructing a virtual table
(using structs) which enables us to apply dynamic dispatching based on the
specific type of the printer. Basically, we copied the idea applied by the C++
compiler (over simplifying it) to implement dynamic dispatching on the top of C.
\\
Currently, FAC supports three printers:
\begin{itemize}
\item IR (Internal Representation) -- useful for educational purposes or to
quickly debug the 3AC;
\item C -- prints a C program;
\item Java\footnote{For time reasons only the skeleton has been implemented.}
-- prints a Java program.
\end{itemize}

The rational behind this choice is the extensibility. Indeed in the future
FAC could be extended even with target machine specific printers.
