\section{Three Address Code}
We chose to implement the indirect triples approach to represent internally
the three address code. As reported by the Dragon Book this representation 
can help in optimizing the resulting code, because the instructions can be 
easily swapped to improve the performances.

We generate the three address code starting from the AST, which does not contain
type errors.
