\section{Three Address Code}
FAC represents the three address code (3AC) using indirect triples. 
As stated by Aho et al. \cite{dragonbook}, this 
representation can help during the code optimization phase.
Indeed, the code optimizer can easily reorder the instructions without affecting
the triples themselves. We used a doubly-linked list instead of a single-linked
one to make it traversable in both directions.

FAC generates the 3AC from the AST filtered by the type checker. 

While traversing the AST we generate the three address code in a bottom up
fashion using \emph{only} synthesized attributes. This makes the three address
code generator intuitive.

The 3AC representation of the example code \ref{f-code1} is depicted in 
Fig. \ref{fig:ind-trpl}.
