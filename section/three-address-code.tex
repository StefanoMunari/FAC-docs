\section{Three Address Code}
We chose to implement the indirect triples approach to represent internally
the three address code. As stated in the Dragon Book\footnote{Alfred V. Aho,
Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman. 2006. Compilers: Principles,
Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition). Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co.,
Inc., Boston, MA, USA.} this representation
can help in optimizing the resulting code, because the instructions can be
easily swapped to improve the performances.

We generate the three address code from an AST, that passed the type checking
phase. To make it even easier to deal the instructions we chose to use
doubly-linked lists.

While traversing the AST we generate the three address code in a bottom up
fashion using \emph{only} syntethised attributes. This makes the three address
code generator intuitive.
