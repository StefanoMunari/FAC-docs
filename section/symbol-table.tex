\section{Symbol Table}
The symbol table has been implemented using
\href{https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/}{uthash} because it is a reliable
and efficient solution to implement a symbol table.
\\
Basically, the symbol table contains the variables used in the program.
For each variable the symbol table stores:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the identifier;
	\item the type;
	\item value.
\end{itemize}

The symbol table is fundamental during the type checking and also during the
code generation phase. During the first phase it provides the type to the
type checker while during the second phase it provides also the value.
