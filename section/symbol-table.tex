\section{Symbol Table}
We have implemented the symbol table using
\href{https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/}{uthash} because it is simple, reliable and efficient. Basically, the symbol table contains the variables used in the program. For each of them it stores:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the identifier;
	\item the type.
\end{itemize}

The symbol table is fundamental during two phases:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Type checking - it provides the correct type to the type checker;
	\item Code generation - it provides the address of the variable for the
	indirect triple representation.
\end{itemize}
More details on its initialization can be found in section \ref{sec:type-checking}.
