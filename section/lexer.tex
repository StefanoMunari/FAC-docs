\section{Lexer}
The lexical analyzer has been written using flex.
It has the following responsabilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify that the input stream is lexically correct;
\item Produce the token stream for the parser;
\item Set the \verb|bison/flex| variable \verb|yylloc| -- this
variable contains the information about the first column, last column,
first row and last row of the token read. More details on its usage in
bison can be read in the bison section \ref{sec:parser}.
\item Launch an error in case of a fract constant with denominator equal
to $0$ -- it is simply not considered as a valid lexeme.
\end{itemize}
